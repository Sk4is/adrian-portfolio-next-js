## Description

Eye of the Doom is an intense, fate-driven game where players take on the role of astronauts trapped in a cosmic arena. Frozen in place, they face an ominous, massive eye that randomly eliminates players with deadly beams of energy. The game revolves around chance and survival, with the last astronaut standing emerging as the ultimate victor.

## Development

The development of this game focused on creating an immersive, engaging web experience using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. The design of the game combines minimalist, yet striking visuals to convey the sense of impending doom, while the gameplay mechanics revolve around suspense and unpredictability, keeping players on the edge of their seats.

The development team used Agile methodology and SCRUM, with roles clearly defined for smooth project management. The SCRUM Master, Mario Lebrero García, ensured the team stayed on track, while Product Owner Jesús Manuel García Lozano guided the project vision. The development work was carried out by Mauricio Nicolás Ortiz, Fernando de la Torre Esperón, Samuel Utrilla Núñez, and Adrián Pérez Agredano, who contributed to coding, testing, and overall game refinement.

## Stacks

- **HTML5**: Utilized to build modern, responsive, and SEO-friendly web applications. HTML5 allows for the creation of fast, server-rendered React applications with semantic structure, improving accessibility and performance.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling and managing design assets, CSS3 helps bring visual consistency and dynamic interactions to web applications. It’s ideal for creating clean, scalable layouts and ensuring seamless user interfaces with animations and transitions.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework that provides pre-built, responsive design elements and components. It streamlines the styling process in React applications by using a modular, customizable, and themable approach, enhancing development speed and consistency.
- **JavaScript**: The backbone of dynamic web applications, JavaScript is used to build interactive, data-driven, and responsive component libraries. It ensures that React components function smoothly, providing rich user experiences and enabling the integration of complex business logic.

## Next Steps

The next steps for the application include enhancing the gameplay experience by adding additional astronaut positions, polishing animations, and improving functionality. Additionally, the team plans to implement code testing and create a victory animation to further enhance user engagement and the overall robustness of the game.

## To Conclude...

Eye of the Doom is more than just a game—it's a thrilling experiment in suspense and the unpredictability of fate. The combination of strategic design, chance-based gameplay, and immersive visuals creates a uniquely intense experience where players can only rely on luck to survive. The development journey, guided by Agile methodologies and a collaborative SCRUM approach, highlights the team's dedication to delivering a polished, engaging, and constantly evolving game.

Looking ahead, the potential for deeper gameplay elements, enhanced animations, and refined mechanics promises an even more captivating experience. This project serves as a reminder that sometimes, the most exciting challenges come not from skill, but from the unknown forces that guide our fate—making Eye of the Doom an exhilarating cosmic journey that players won't soon forget.
